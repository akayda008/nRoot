    `The success of nRoot as part of Atma-Nirbhar Bharat campaign relies upon the understanding of the operational needs at field level and the potential of the cutting-edge technologies. We firmly believe that impact of the indigenous efforts can be exponential only if the input includes innovation by instinct. We also believe that while competition in the industry leads to better quality, only collaboration can ensure growth and sustenance.`,

    `We strictly adhere to our motto Educate-Equip-Empower wherein we educate all the stakeholders including ourselves about the gap between demand and supply, equip them with innovative solutions and empower them through indigenous products and services. In order to achieve this tall order, we undertake various activities ranging from participating and organizing awareness campaigns, workshops, seminars, competitions, hackathons, open challenges besides offering internship and industrial training to students, supporting MSMEs to understand defence procurement procedure and GeM portal, and display/demonstrations of our products to the armed forces.`,

    `In addition to the R&D based business activities we also undertake various CSR activities despite being a micro company. We are privileged to have instituted the nRoot Awards which is being accepted by many stalwarts in various walks of life in the society. We also firmly believe that a company with strong ethos and robust culture only can retain edge in this competitive world. Within a span of just about four years we have had a great stride in terms of innovations, academic programs as well as CSR activities. We give a glimpse of our activities in this gallery.`
