- Found 53 component files that are not imported anywhere (possible dead code). Consider removing or consolidating them.
- Found 1 groups of duplicate files. Consider consolidating duplicates to reduce maintenance.
- Found 27 large files (>= 200 KB). Consider optimizing images or moving to a CDN.
- Some files use <Image> without width/height or fill; consider adding dimensions or using fill with aspect-ratio container for Next.js optimization.
